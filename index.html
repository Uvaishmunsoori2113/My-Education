            <p class="small">In recent years, the education industry has shifted toward a greater proportion of online
                teaching and learning experiences. Most colleges and universities today include a substantial eLearning
                component to their teaching and learning strategies. What are the next steps in terms of improving the
                online learning experience, now that the technology is in place and courses are widely available online?

            <p class="big">Major Increase In Soft Skills Training</p>
            <p class="small">According to the "Future of Jobs" research [1], critical thinking, problem-solving, people
                management, and creativity are among the most crucial workplace talents [2]. Employers want to see
                emerging professionals who can make difficult judgments and demonstrate leadership ability. Schools must
                provide training to help students foster and improve in these skill areas in order to better prepare
                them for their future employment.</p>

            <p class="small">The first distinction to make is that game-based learning is not the same as gamification.
                Game-based learning is a method of teaching that uses game elements to assist students to reach specific
                learning goals [3]. Gamification is the use of game elements to traditional learning techniques in order
                to boost student engagement </p>

            <p class="big">AI-Driven Learning</p>
            <p class="small">Artificial Intelligence (AI) was also on our list of education trends for 2021, and it
                remains a prominent topic. Artificial Intelligence refers to a machine’s ability to exhibit human-like
                qualities such as reasoning, learning, planning, and creativity. It is already utilized in business
                education, with examples including translation software, plagiarism checks, text editing tools,
                voice-recording transcripts, and so on, but its potential for further development is vast.</p>

            <p class="small">Course quality will be an issue that higher education institutions need to address in 2022.
                Learners have come to demand a higher level of online course design as part of any teaching and learning
                experience. While some schools have on-the-ground learning designers assisting in the effective
                production of online courses, many others are catching up.</p>
